Big oh notation (O) 
Big oh notation is used to describe asymptotic upper bound. 
It is define as upper bound and upper bound on an algorithm is the most amount of time required ( the worst case performance).
0 <= f(n) <= Cg(n) for all n >= n0

Big Omega notation (Ω) 
Big Omega notation provides asymptotic lower bound. 
It is define as lower bound and lower bound on an algorithm is the least amount of time required ( the most efficient way possible, in other words best case).
0 <= Cg(n) <= f(n) for all n >= n0

Big Theta notation (Θ) 
It is define as tightest bound and tightest bound is the best of all the worst case times that the algorithm can take.
0 <= C2g(n) <= f(n) <= C1g(n) for n >= n0
